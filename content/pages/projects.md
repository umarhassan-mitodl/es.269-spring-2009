Project Topic: Melungeons

Wikipedia article about the {{% resource_link "f9dcfa0f-e94a-4574-bba0-cc18bce94ef2" "Melungeons" %}}.

Melungeons are a group of mixed race people who live in Southern Appalachia. They are a racial melting pot. Kevin Jones did a DNA study of descendents of Melungeon families. He found that their ancestry contained a mix of white, black, Native American, South Asian, gypsy, Sephardic Jewish, Arabic, Moorish, and Turkish races.

There are lots of myths about their origins. One states that Melungeons are descendants of Portuguese explorers, which is not entirely true. Most of them do have Portuguese and Sephardic ancestry. Many of them are descended from white and gypsy indentured servants; Scotch Irish colonists, and free blacks. Appalachia was a popular place for escaped slaves because it was isolated and away from the plantation areas. Sephardic Jewish heritage may have come through indentured servants.

They were initially portrayed as atheists and anarchists, but were later determined to be Baptists. Melungeons aggressively tried to pass as white. They intermarried whites and light skinned Melungeons, and eventually the group got lighter over time. They often had a lot of legal trouble to establish they were white. There was a court case in the late 1800's, where a man was charged with illegal voting because he was black. He won the case by establishing he "acted white". Melungeon surnames are often common names because they are of English/Scottish/Irish heritage. For example, Kennedy is a very popular Melungeon name.

The term Melungeon was originally imposed upon them by outsiders. In the mid-20th century, they claimed it as their own. It is possibly a French term, or sub-Saharan African. In Turkish "Melungeon" means cursed one.

The Civil War was a difficult time for them because race was scrutinized so closely. They pretty much ran the Underground Railroad in Appalachia on both sides of the Mason-Dixon line.

"{{% resource_link "e97f3ed7-5507-41ba-8716-49426a0eb535" "Walking Towards the Sunset" %}}" was a play that had a Melungeon character and helped create a resurgence of interest in Melungeon heritage.

It calls to mind the story of {{% resource_link "755b5e01-decc-4457-8c66-1783095bde28" "Billy Tipton" %}}, an actual jazz musician who passed as male. He had a wife and three adopted sons.

Project Topic: Kanun of Albania

_New York Times_ article about the {{% resource_link "6fee7f46-41aa-4f52-914e-f358b76c8b49" "Kanun" %}}.

In the past, Albanian culture was very patrilineal and remained restricted and difficult for women. There were many issues involving inheritance and blood fueds; often times women were the only heirs available. Women were considered to be worth less than a mule. The community resolved these issues by allowing women to "become men" and thus inherit property and to lead revenge killings. These women were known as Kanun or sworn virgins. The women would alter their hair and clothing to reflect male culture. They had to remain unmarried and celibate. They were men in intent. These women could receive power and status by becoming men. They could be heads of their families and communities. It is estimated that about 40 Kanun still are alive.
